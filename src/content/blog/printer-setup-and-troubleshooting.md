Printers can be frustrating, but most issues are easy to fix with a calm, step‑by‑step approach.

## Common problems

- Printer not showing up on Wi‑Fi
- “Offline” errors
- Ink warnings or streaky prints
- Print jobs stuck in the queue

## Quick setup tips

1. **Place the printer near the router** for the first setup.
2. **Use the printer screen** to connect to Wi‑Fi.
3. **Install drivers** from the printer brand’s website.
4. **Print a test page** to confirm it works.

## Quick fixes you can try

1. **Restart printer and router** (power off for 30 seconds).
2. **Reconnect Wi‑Fi** using the printer panel.
3. **Update printer drivers** on the computer.
4. **Clear the print queue** (stuck jobs cause “offline” errors).
5. **Replace low ink** and run a cleaning cycle if print quality is bad.

## When to call for help

If the printer still won’t connect, or it keeps going offline, I can get it set up properly and make sure it stays that way.
