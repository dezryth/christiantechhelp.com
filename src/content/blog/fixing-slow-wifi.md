Slow Wi‑Fi can make everything feel broken—video calls freeze, streaming buffers, and pages take forever. The good news: most issues are fixable with a few simple steps.

## Common causes of slow Wi‑Fi

- **Outdated router**: Older gear can’t keep up with modern devices.
- **Too many devices**: Smart TVs, phones, and tablets all share the same pipe.
- **Bad placement**: Routers hidden in a closet or behind a TV lose signal fast.
- **Interference**: Microwaves, neighbors, and thick walls can block Wi‑Fi.
- **ISP issues**: Sometimes the internet company is the bottleneck.

## Step‑by‑step fixes (try in order)

1. **Restart everything**: Unplug modem and router for 30 seconds. Plug in modem first, wait 60 seconds, then router.
2. **Run a speed test**: Use [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net). Compare results to your plan.
3. **Move the router**: Put it high, central, and away from metal or thick walls.
4. **Use the 5GHz network**: Faster for devices close to the router. 2.4GHz goes farther but is slower.
5. **Update router firmware**: Usually in the router app or web admin page.
6. **Check for congestion**: If your router has “channel” settings, switch to the least crowded one.
7. **Limit background usage**: Large downloads can slow everyone else down.

## When to upgrade

If your router is 5–7+ years old or you have dead zones, a **Wi‑Fi 6 router** or a **mesh system** can be a huge improvement.

## Quick checklist

- Modem and router power‑cycled
- Router in a central, open location
- 5GHz used for nearby devices
- Firmware updated
