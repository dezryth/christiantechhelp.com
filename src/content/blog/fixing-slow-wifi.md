# Fixing Slow WiFi: Step-by-Step Guide

Slow WiFi ruining your day? Here's how to diagnose & fix (no tech degree needed).

## Common Causes of Slow Wi-Fi

- **Outdated router**: Can't handle Wi-Fi 6/5GHz.
- **Too many devices**: Network congestion.
- **Bad position**: Walls/interference (microwave, neighbors).
- **ISP throttling**: Test wired vs wireless.
- **Old cables/drivers**: Check Ethernet too.

## Fix It Step-by-Step

1. **Restart modem/router/devices**: Unplug 30s, power on modem first.
2. **Test speed**: [speedtest.net](speedtest.net)—compare to ISP plan.
3. **Optimize channel**: Router app/admin (192.168.1.1) > WiFi > Scan & pick least crowded (1/6/11).
4. **Switch to 5GHz**: Faster, less range—perfect for close devices.
5. **Reposition router**: Central, high shelf, no metal/ microwave nearby.
6. **Update firmware**: Router admin > Check updates.
7. **Prioritize devices**: QoS settings for PC/TV over IoT.
8. **Upgrade hardware**: Wi-Fi 6 router if >50 devices.
9. **Call pro**: Can't DIY? ☎️ (469) 844-0493—quick $75/hr fix!

Most fixed by #1-3. Test after each step. Persistent? Hardware or ISP issue.
