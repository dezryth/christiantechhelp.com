AI can save hours each week if you start small and keep it practical. Think of it like a helpful assistant for writing, organizing, and summarizing.

## Easy wins (no tech skills needed)

- **Summarize long emails** before meetings
- **Draft replies** faster with a simple prompt
- **Turn notes into checklists**
- **Rewrite text** to sound clearer and more professional
- **Create outlines** for documents or presentations

## A simple workflow anyone can try

1. Paste a long email into an AI tool
2. Ask: “Summarize this in 5 bullets.”
3. Ask: “Write a friendly reply confirming the next steps.”
4. Edit and send

## Sample prompts

- “Rewrite this to sound friendly and clear.”
- “Turn these notes into a to‑do list.”
- “Explain this in plain English.”

## Privacy tip

Avoid sharing passwords, bank info, or anything sensitive. Keep it general and safe.
