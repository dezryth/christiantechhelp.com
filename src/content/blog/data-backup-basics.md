Photos, documents, and memories matter. A basic backup plan is easier than most people think—and it can save you from heartbreak later.

## The simple 3‑2‑1 rule

- **3** copies of your data
- **2** different storage types (external drive + cloud)
- **1** copy off‑site

That sounds fancy, but it just means: keep your files in more than one place.

## Easy backup setup

1. **External drive**: Plug it in weekly or use automatic backups.
2. **Cloud backup**: iCloud, OneDrive, or Google Drive for daily syncing.
3. **Test a restore** once so you know it actually works.

## What should you back up?

- Family photos and videos
- Tax documents and receipts
- Passwords (if not already in a password manager)
- Important work files

## How often?

If you take photos often, weekly backups are a good habit. Cloud backups can run automatically in the background.
