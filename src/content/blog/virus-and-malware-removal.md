If your computer is running hot, showing pop‑ups, or acting strange, don’t panic. Most malware can be removed safely with a few careful steps.

## Common signs of malware

- Pop‑ups or random tabs opening by themselves
- Browser homepage or search engine changed
- Slower performance even after a reboot
- New apps you didn’t install
- Security warnings that look fake

## What to do first (safe steps)

1. **Disconnect from the internet** to prevent data from leaking.
2. **Save important files** (photos, documents) to an external drive if possible.
3. **Run a trusted scan**:
	- Windows: Windows Security (built‑in)
	- Mac: Use a reputable scanner like Malwarebytes
4. **Remove suspicious apps** you don’t recognize.
5. **Update your system and browser** after cleanup.

## What *not* to do

- Don’t click “Your computer is infected!” pop‑ups.
- Don’t install random “cleaner” apps from ads.
- Don’t keep using the device for banking until it’s clean.

## After cleanup

- Change key passwords (email, banking) from a clean device.
- Turn on automatic updates.
- Consider a password manager for safer logins.

## When to call for help

If the infection keeps coming back, or you’re worried about sensitive information, it’s best to get professional help.
