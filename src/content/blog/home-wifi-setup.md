A good Wi‑Fi setup makes everything faster and more reliable—streaming, video calls, and smart devices all benefit. Here’s a simple, no‑stress guide.

## Setup basics

- **Place the router in the center** of the home and up high.
- **Avoid hiding it** in a cabinet or behind the TV.
- **Use 5GHz** for nearby devices; **2.4GHz** for longer range.
- **Name your network clearly** (example: “SmithHome‑5G”).
- **Set a strong password** and don’t share it widely.

## A quick walkthrough

1. Plug in the modem and router and wait for the lights to stabilize.
2. Connect a phone or laptop to the Wi‑Fi.
3. Open the router app or web page to finish setup.
4. Set a network name and password you’ll remember.
5. Update firmware if the router prompts you.

## Helpful extras

- **Create a guest network** for visitors or smart home devices.
- **Run a speed test** after setup to confirm performance.
- **Reboot once a month** if things get flaky.

## When to consider an upgrade

If you have lots of devices or dead zones, a **Wi‑Fi 6 router** or **mesh system** can make a big difference.
