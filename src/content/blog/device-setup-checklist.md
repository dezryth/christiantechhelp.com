Unboxing a new device is exciting, but a good setup now saves headaches later. Here’s a friendly checklist anyone can follow.

## Essentials

- **Install updates** right away (these fix bugs and security issues).
- **Set up accounts** (email, iCloud/Google/OneDrive).
- **Enable a screen lock** (PIN or fingerprint).
- **Install antivirus or security tools** if needed.
- **Restore data** from your old device (photos, contacts, files).
- **Connect Wi‑Fi and printers** so everything works on day one.

## Optional (but smart)

- Turn on **Find My** / device tracking
- Enable **automatic backups**
- Remove apps you don’t need (bloatware)
- Set up **two‑factor authentication** on key accounts

## Quick tip

If you’re moving from an old device, keep it nearby until you confirm everything is transferred and backed up.
