AI isn’t sci‑fi—it’s a helpful assistant you can use today. The goal is simple: save time on the boring stuff (summaries, drafts, lists) so you can focus on people and priorities.

## Who this helps most

- Busy parents juggling emails and schedules
- Small business owners writing messages or proposals
- Anyone who wants clearer writing, faster research, or fewer to‑dos

## Top AI tools & quick wins

1. **ChatGPT or Claude**: Summarize emails/meetings, draft replies, brainstorm ideas (example: “Write a friendly reply confirming an appointment next Tuesday at 3pm”).
2. **Grammarly or Wordtune**: Fix tone/grammar in emails and documents—great for professional polish.
3. **Notion AI or Mem**: Ask questions about your notes (“What tasks mention billing?”) and get quick answers.
4. **Zapier Agents**: Automate small tasks (“Summarize new leads → send to Slack/email”).
5. **Perplexity**: AI search with sources for quick research.
6. **Reclaim or Clockwise**: AI scheduling to protect focus time.

## Easy, real‑life examples

- **Summarize a long email**: “Summarize this email into 5 bullets.”
- **Draft a response**: “Write a polite reply saying I can call after 2pm.”
- **Create a checklist**: “Turn these notes into a step‑by‑step checklist.”
- **Make a plan**: “Create a 1‑week meal plan under $100.”

## A simple first workflow

1. Copy a long email or notes into an AI tool.
2. Ask for a short summary.
3. Ask for a reply draft you can edit.
4. Save your best prompt for next time.

## Privacy tips (important!)

Don’t paste in passwords, bank info, or anything you wouldn’t want shared. If it’s sensitive, keep it high‑level.
