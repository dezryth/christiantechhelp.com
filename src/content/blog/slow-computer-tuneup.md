Most slow computers can be fixed without replacing them. Try these friendly, low‑risk steps first.

## Quick tune‑up checklist

1. **Restart** (seriously—it helps).  
2. **Close extra tabs and apps** you’re not using.  
3. **Remove unused apps** (Settings → Apps on Windows).  
4. **Clear startup programs** (Task Manager → Startup).  
5. **Free disk space** (delete old downloads and empty the trash).  
6. **Update the OS and browser** so you get performance and security fixes.  
7. **Run a malware scan** just in case.  

## Extra tips that help a lot

- **Check storage type**: Older hard drives are slow. A solid‑state drive (SSD) is a huge speed boost.
- **Keep at least 15–20% of disk space free** so the system can breathe.
- **Limit browser extensions**—too many can slow everything down.

## When an upgrade makes sense

If your device is 6–8+ years old, has very little storage, or struggles even after cleanup, a simple **SSD upgrade** (and sometimes a RAM upgrade) can make it feel new again.
