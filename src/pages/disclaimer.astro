  <p>Christian Tech Help provides general technology advice and repair services. While we do our best to help, all services are provided “as-is” without warranties.</p>

  <p>Technology issues can be complex and sometimes unpredictable. We do not guarantee specific outcomes, and we are not responsible for incidental or consequential damages. We are not responsible for data loss or corruption unless caused by our gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>

  <p>If you need data protection, please ensure you have a current backup before service. We can assist with backup setup if you request it.</p>

  <p>Payments are typically due after services are rendered unless otherwise specified. Invoices and payments are handled through Square.</p>

  <p>If you have questions, email <a href="mailto:scott@christiantechhelp.com">scott@christiantechhelp.com</a>.</p>
