    Hi there! I'm Scott. I've been working in Information Technology and Software Development for over a decade.
    I love to help people, and I created Christian Tech Help so I could put my technical skills to use to serve the community in and around Carrollton, TX.

    Please excuse me for the current state of the site. I just started getting this business running recently so I have not had much time to put everything together.
